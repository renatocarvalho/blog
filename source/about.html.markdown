I'm a front-end designer and developer based in the Philippines. I love discussing about art, design, programming, html5 and javascript among everything else. Aside from web design and development, my other interest is with html5 games.

I ocassionally do [illustration and digital art](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Wings-Of-Lemuria/1490021) and sometimes I [write and arrange songs](http://soundcloud.com/jamesflorentino) as a hobby. I have a wife and two kids. So far living a simple, happy and productive life.
