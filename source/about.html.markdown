I'm a front-end designer and developer based in the Philippines. I love discussing about art, design, programming, html5 and javascript among everything else. Aside from web design and development, my other interest is with html5 games.

I use git for my source code management (as well as making entries to this blog with markdown). I'm very passionate about my work because I think it's a great time to be a web designer/developer thanks to the open source community. My [GitHub page](https://github.com/jamesflorentino) contains a list of repositories of my experimental and open source projects.

I ocassionally do [illustration and digital art](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Wings-Of-Lemuria/1490021) and sometimes I [write and arrange songs](http://soundcloud.com/jamesflorentino) as a hobby. When I'm bored, I help people out in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1089685/james-florentino). I have a wife and two kids. So far living a simple, happy and productive life.
